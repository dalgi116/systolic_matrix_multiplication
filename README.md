## Goals
- Make 4x4 matrix multiplier on FPGA Cora Z7 for 16bit fix-point numbers using NSA systolic array method
- Extend the multiplier to 8x8
- Make a MATLAB code to control the matrix multiplier
- Write a code for ARM CPU on the FPGA board
- Compare the calculation speed of the CPU and the FPGA
- Extend the setup to be able to calculate with larger block matrices
- Compare the calculation speed of the CPU and the FPGA
